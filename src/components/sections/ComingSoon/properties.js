    markdown: `### About the Property.
    Spacious and charming one bedroom apartment with high ceilings. It's transit access is extremely good, being mere steps to B, C, and D branches of Boston Metro's Green Line. While it is surrounded by vibrant eateries and popular jaunts, the building itself is on a very quiet residential street. The building has its own laundry facilities and an elevator, it also has a rooftop deck and a community garden for the use of occupants.
    
    It is also situated next to Chestnut Hill reservoir; one of Boston's most loved and attractive jogging spaces. The building's close proximity to Boston College and other universities guarantees its thus far perfect occupancy record through economic weathers fair and foul.

    ### Token-holder Rights.
    Thread Token holders (Tokenholders) own voting rights in the Thread, that may directly affect the Property.
    
    Tokenholders also have an automatic claim on any funds raised on the sale of said property during a Dissolution, even if the WeavrDAO Debt Co exercises itâ€™s security interest to take control of the property.
    
    As this Thread has a Governor/Operator Tenant Iâ€™m pleased to announce that this Thread uses a token burning revenue distribution system, which means that any revenue generated will be used to buy Thread tokens off of the market; and burn them. This provides the most flexibility and security to you, the Tokenholder.
    
    ### Fund Management System
    If expenses are deducted from the Expense Budget, that Expense Budget will be refilled by any revenue generated.
    
    If the Expense Budget Account is full, all remaining revenue will be used to buy Thread Tokens from the Limit Order Decentralized Exchange (ILO DEX) (or create a buy order at the last sold price).
    
    If the Expense Budget Account is full, all remaining revenue will be used to buy Thread Tokens from the Limit Order Decentralized Exchange (ILO DEX) (or create a buy order at the last sold price).
    
    ðŸ’¡ If there is only 1 TH token @$1000 USDC, then only 1 TH token is acquired.
    
    **5%** of the acquired tokens will be provided to the Governor to compensate them for their work done.
    **85%** will be burned by transferring them to the null Ethereum address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
